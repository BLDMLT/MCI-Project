Agenda
Chair: Junzhe Huang
Secretary: Sicheng Xin
Members: Qianyang Tang

1 Apologies
None.

2 Presentation
Solve the asynchronous problem of Nodejs, and use the programming logic to integrate the previously completed methods together.
The HTML file cannot load the Node.js program as expected, and the solution needs to be discussed.

3 Requirements Elicitation
At this stage, we have not checked the validity of the user's input, which is very unfriendly to the user's experience.
Follow-up will add a feedback based on user input, the purpose is to tell the user whether the program runs successfully.

4 Other Issues
Understand the file system. Since there is no API and administrator rights for the Web submission platform, 
we are likely to use virtual machines as our external resources.

Note: The next meeting will be hold at 4pm on every Thursday via Zoom.
