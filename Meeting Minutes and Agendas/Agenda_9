1 Apologies
None.

2 Presentation
Regarding the design of the user interface, we discussed whether it is necessary to add some additional functions.
Each part has been completed and passed the test. Use callback functions to integrate the parts together.

3 Requirements Elicitation
Because we use the "express" template,it can create multiple sub-pages by using get function, 
and we will use the relevant code in the HTML file to connect them if neccessary.
It will benefit the expansion of our web page in the future.

4 Other Issues
The other issues are mainly about the discussion of extended functions.
For example, whether to add a history review function or whether to add a data timing synchronization function.

Note: The next meeting will be hold at 4pm on every Thursday via Zoom.
