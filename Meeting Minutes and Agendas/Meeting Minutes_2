Chair: Junzhe Huang
Secretary: Sicheng Xin
Members: Qianyang Tang
Apologies: No

The plan of the next week:

We have been added as auditing students on Web and Database Computing for both 2019 and 2020. The NodeJS and express resources in there should be able to get our started.
We also have a teacher access to Ian's personal MyUni Sandbox. There we can add & modify assignments, and we should be able to use the API to do so.
The documentation on the API here https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/ 
There may be NodeJS packages that make accessing the parts of the API that you need easier.
Focus on getting a basic express server going that can modify the grades of an assignment.
