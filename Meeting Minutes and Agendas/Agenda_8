1 Apologies
None.

2 Presentation
Connect to the virtual machine remotely based on its IP address and obtain data from the virtual machine.
Learn how to change files in the virtual machine, and make reasonable changes to the score data in order to test the program.

3 Requirements Elicitation
Since we chose the virtual machine as the external resource platform, 
the information about the registered users of the virtual machine also had to be used as the necessary input key information.
In actual applications, these should be built into the program rather than requiring user input.

4 Other Issues
During the process of obtaining the IP address of the virtual machine, 
some of our team members failed to obtain the IP address of IPv4 as expected but the IP address of IPv6.
This problem prevented them from successfully connecting to the virtual machine.

Note: The next meeting will be hold at 4pm on every Thursday via Zoom.
