The plan of the next week:

Successfully complete the remote connection with the virtual machine and parse the student score file in the specified directory of it.

According to Myuni's sandbox course, the data of the student's score file in the virtual machine (mainly about the student number) is 
reasonably modified, and several sets of test data are designed to test the code. 

Before the end of next week, complete the code compilation and program testing of the process of obtaining student scores from the virtual machine.
